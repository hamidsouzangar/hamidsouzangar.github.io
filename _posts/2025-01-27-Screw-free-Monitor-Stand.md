![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b5bc338-49c5-47b8-97e1-71c187422f8a)

## Project Overview
This project showcases a custom-built monitor stand, designed and fabricated using a 3mm MDF sheet and laser cutting technology. The primary objective of this design was to assemble the stand without the need for any glue, screws, nuts, or other fasteners. The stand features a drawer, and two STL files are included to demonstrate the stand in both its closed and open drawer states.
