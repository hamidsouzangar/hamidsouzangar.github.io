# WebLog of Hamidreza Souzangarzadeh

professional portfolio and technical blog, hosted on GitHub Pages at the following URL: [https://hamidsouzangar.github.io](https://hamidsouzangar.github.io). The platform functions as an enhanced digital CV, designed to showcase practical projects, technical insights, and professional reflections. Unlike traditional career portfolios, the content emphasizes real-world applications and accessible knowledge sharing for general audiences rather than catering specifically to recruitment professionals.

The site utilizes the Chirpy Jekyll theme for its architecture and design. Below you'll find the original README documentation from the base Chirpy theme repository that was forked to create this implementation. The repository was cloned and customized in accordance with the theme's installation guidelines to establish this web presence.


## Chirpy Jekyll Theme
[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)][gem]&nbsp;
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders
`_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `_config.yml` file
from the theme's gem. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command
`bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user’s court, but this also results in users not being
able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your
Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the
latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.
