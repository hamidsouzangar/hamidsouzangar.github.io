![My Image](assets/img/about.png)


I am a researcher with an` M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering` from Azad University and expertise in finite element analysis (FEA), decision science, and engineering design. My research portfolio includes several `published research papers` on topics such as FEA, crash box crushing experimental tests, operations research, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM), design of experiments (DoE), machine learning (regression), and optimization.  

I have been an active member of the engineering community, serving as a reviewer for several journals. I am committed to pushing new boundaries to benefit the community. With my vast knowledge and passion, I continuously strive to broaden my skill set in my chosen disciplines, motivated by a desire to make a significant contribution to the field.

### My Expertise Includes:
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**
- **Energy Absorption Crushing Experimental Tests**
- **Multi-Attributes Decision-Making (MADM)**
- **Design of Experiments (DoE)**
- **Optimization**
- **Machine Learning (regression)**

### My Work and Hobbies

In addition to my research, I enjoy working with laser cutting technology to create a variety of artifacts, including board games, boxes, and holders for items like laptops and phones. I use CAD software like `CATIA` and `SolidWorks`, along with vector-based tools like `Corel`, to design and provide files for `laser cutting`.

I also model `3D objects`, primarily for 3D printing with the `printer` I built myself. This hands-on work allows me to bring my ideas to life in the real world, and I love sharing this process with others.

The purpose of this weblog is to document and share my real-world projects, experiences, and insights. Itâ€™s a place where I can showcase the things I create, whether they are research-related or personal projects, and connect with others who share similar interests in engineering, design, and innovation.
